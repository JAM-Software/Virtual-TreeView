= Latest news on the Virtual Treeview Control =

== 11 Sep 2014: Release of V5.4.1 ==
List of changes: (*[https://www.jam-software.de/customers/downloadTrial.php?article_no=407&language=EN Download]*)
  * Added packages for RAD Studio XE7 / Delphi XE7
  * Fixed issue #464: Vertical grid lines not computed correctly for spanned cells with header auto resize
  * Fixed issue #442: Scrollbars are not updated for active VCL Style under XE2
  * Fixed issue #463: HTML export shows grid lines in IE and Chrome, but not in Firefox
  * Fixed issue #460: Access violation in design time when setting "CheckBox" to True for a Virtual Treeview Column
  * Fixed issue #72: Call Application.CancelHint only if the current control is showing the hint
  * Fixed issue #461: corrected condition in TBaseVirtualTree.ScrollIntoView, so that not only partially (by the fixed area) covered columns but also totally covered columns are scrolled in view
  * Fixed issue #450: Regional letters entered using Right+Alt should also trigger the incremental search.
  * Improvements for toAlwaysSelectNode: 
    Clicking the free space below the tree nodes no longer deselects the selected node. 
    We now prevent toggling of the selection of the last selected node if toAlwaysSelectNode is set in TreeOptions.
  * Fixed issue #447: SetChildCount() now calls DoMeasureItem() instead of using DefaultNodeHeight.
  * Fixed issue #444: ERangeError in TBaseVirtualTree.CMMouseWheel
  * TBaseVirtualTree.MeasureItemHeight() is virtual now.
  * Fixed issue #445 MultiSelect behavior: Can't drag node which is not selected
  * Fixed Issue #443: TVirtualTreeColumns.ColumnFromPosition on right border of fixed column
  * Fixed issue #339: Problems with fixed column 
  * Implemented #410: Small extension of TStringEditLink: Allow creating own edit control by moving the creation of TVTEdit from constructor to virtual PrepareEdit with assigned check.
  * Implemented #409: Extend THitInfo record with hit coordinates
  * Added suggestions of #438: Make some members visible to derived classes
  * Fixed issue #440: Context menu does not pop up if there is no selected node
  * Added C++ Builder link demand to VirtualTreesR.Lib as {$HPPEMIT}
  * Improved installation instructions, especially for C++ Builder
  
== 26 May 2014: Release of V5.4.1 ==
  * Added packages for C++ Builder XE6
  * If toAutoChangeScale is set in AutoOptions, the Virtual TreeView control now increases the DefaultNodeHeight if the font size is too large to fit.
  * If toAutoChangeScale is set in AutoOptions, the columns widths are now adjusted too.
  * Improved implementation for toRestoreSelection option
  * Fixed possible AV in PaintNodeButton()
  * Now ensuring that both GetHorzScrollBarSliderRect() and GetVertScrollBarSliderRect() return a valid value for every code path (Thx to Dmitri Dmitrienko). This could cause strange out of resources exceptions with VCL styles enabled.
  * Fixed issue #434: Application compiled with Delphi 7 stops responding when you call AddChild 
  * A few minor changes  


== 24 Apr 2014: JAM Software takes Virtual Treeview under its wing ==
*JAM Software* takes Virtual Treeview under its wing, but not much will change besides the homepage and download location. Please read this [http://www.jam-software.com/company/press/EN/April%2022%202014%20-%20Virtual%20Treeview%20-%20JAM%20Software%20takes%20Virtual%20Treeview.pdf press release] for further details.



== 23 Apr 2014: Release of V5.4.0 ==
List of changes:
  * Added support for XE6.
  * Added new option toRestoreSelection to TVTSelectionOptions: Set to true if upon refill the previously selected nodes should be selected again. The nodes will be identified by its caption only.
  * Added new option toAlwaysSelectNode to TVTSelectionOption enum. If this flag is set, the treeview tries to always have a node selected. This behavior is closer to the Windows TreeView and useful in Windows Explorer style applications. It is also useful for accessible applications which can indicate having the focus by displaying a selection.
  * Added function TBaseVirtualTree.IsEmpty which returns True if the control has no nodes.  
  * Fixed a wrongly drawn selection after the user scrolled horizontally.
  * Fixed issue #423: Change property TVirtualTreeColumn.Tag to NativeInt. 
  * Implemented #415: Added feature for design time column header dragging and resizing. (Thx to fr0st.brutal)
  * Fixed issue #180: Memory leak in grid demo of Advanced project
  * Implemented #422: Added TBaseVirtualTree.GetFirstChildNoInit() 
  * Fixed issue #420: Add coEditable to TVTColumnOption) by applying the supplied path. Thx to Stefan Glienke.
  * Fixed issue #419: Some issues with changing to edit mode with clicking
  * Fixed issue #430: TVTDragManager memory leak with visual inheritance. Thx to Andreas Hausladen for the patch.
  * Fixed issue #431: Visual bug when using TStringEditLink with large node heights
  * TVclStyleScrollBarsHook.WMMouseMove(): Now preventing possible range check error exception.
  * Now handling WM_MOVE and WM_POSCHNAGED correctly in TVclStyleScrollBarsHook (Thx to Dmitri Dmitrienko)
  * Preventing possible stack overflow in TVirtualTreeHintWindow.ActivateHint (Thx to Dmitri Dmitrienko)
  * Added packages for C++ Builder XE5.
  * Some minor chnages, imporevements and fixes have been incorporated



==15 Jan 2014: No new downloads on Google Code ==
From today Google Code no longer offers to add new downloads. [http://google-opensource.blogspot.de/2013/05/a-change-to-google-code-download-service.html Official reason is misuse]. So we need to seek a new download location.



==04 Jan 2014: Release of V5.4.0==
  * Fix for issue #159 (Cursor missing in edit with non-standard DPI): Ensuring a minimum size of the edit control
  * Fixed issue #403: Declare TVTGetNodeProc as reference to procedure (for D2009+) 
  * Fixed issue #402: TVTEdit.CNCommand discard all notification except EN_UPDATE due to missing inherited
  * Corrected fix for issue #376 (Incorrect selection paint when toGridExtensions is included in the MiscOptions)
  * Fixed issue #401: OnNodeClick event doesn't trigger in some case, coFixed set for a column
  * Modified #316 (concerning r498). The fix for #316 will only be applied in case toMultiSelect is set. If toMultiSelect is not set we can start a drag anywhere in the row.
  * ContentToHTML() and ContentToRTF() now return a string of type RawByteString. Because the generated strings are pre-encoded in UTF-8, the previous type AnsiString caused problems in Delphi 2009+ e.g. when this string was written using the VCL TStreamWriter class. The helper class TBufferedAnsiString therefore uses RywByteString now as type too.
  * Fixed issue #399: EditDelay not working
  * Fixed issue #400: AltGr+A does not behave as expected for foreign keyboard layouts in VTEdit
  * Fixed issue #388: VirtualStringTree with toFixedIndent causes range check error
  * Edit box when editing a node in a tree with toFixedIndent now has the correct indent
  * Fixed issue #392: Now ensuring that MeasureItemHeight() is only called from the main thread.
  * Fixed #383: Clear vsHasChildren for a node without children even if the children count didn't change.
  * Fixed #377: Wrong font (size, etc) in TargetCanvas in MeasureItem for first node
  * Fixed issue #398 (hoAutoResize causes DFM designer to be modified after loading) by calling TControl.Updating()/Updated() in AdjustAutoSize()
  * Preventing possible AV in TBaseVirtualTree.FontChanged()
  * Fixed 32Bit Integer overflows in Win64 build in TBufferedAnsiString.
