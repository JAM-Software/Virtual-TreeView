V5.4.0: (22 Apr 2014)
  * Added support for XE6.
  * Added new option toRestoreSelection to TVTSelectionOptions: Set to true if upon refill the previously
  selected nodes should be selected again. The nodes will be identified by its caption only.
  * Added new option toAlwaysSelectNode to TVTSelectionOption enum. If this flag is set, the treeview tries to
  always have a node selected. This behavior is closer to the Windows TreeView and useful in Windows Explorer
  style applications. It is also useful for accessible applications which can indicate having the focus by displaying a selection.
