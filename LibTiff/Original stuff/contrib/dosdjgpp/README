This directory contains the files necessary to build the free TIFF library
with the DJGPP v2 compiler under MSDOS. Since DJGPP defines the unix flag,
I have created a port.h instead of putting the necessary defines into
tiffcomp.h. Makefiles are included for the top level and the libtiff and
tools directories.

All you have to do is copy the files into the respective directories and run
make. If you want, you can use the conf.bat to do that for you, make sure that
the file is stored with MSDOS text EOL-convention (CR/LF), otherwise the
command.com will not do anything (if you used unzip, use the -a option,
otherwise edit the file and save it again).

Note that you probably will not be able to built the library with the v1.x
versions of djgpp, due to two problems. First, the top makefile calls a
sub-make for each directory and you are likely to run out of memory, since
each recursive invocation of a djgpp v1.x program requires about 130k, to
avoid that, you can enter the directories manually and call make (well, there
are only two dirs). The 2nd problem is that djgpp 1.x doesn't call the
coff2exe (stubify) program when creating an executable. This means that all
programs compiled are not converted to exe and consequently are not available
for calling directly. For the tools directory, you can just call coff2exe for
each program after make finishes, but in the libtiff directory, a few programs
are created during the make process that have to be called for make to
continue (e.g. mkg3states). Make will probably report an error at each
such stage. To fix that, either add a coff2exe call before each program is
called or call coff2exe manually and rerun make (there 2-3 such programs).
