Build instructions for LIBTIFF - CodeWarrior (6.1):
----------------------------------------------------

In this directory you will find a Makefile.script Applescript
file, which should be run in order to build the libtiff code
using MetroWerks CodeWarrior.

Refer to the "metrowerks.note" instructions on building the
library for 68k and PowerPC native code, as well as building
some of the libtiff tools, which are rather unix-like, but
at least give an example of how to link everything together.

  Questions, comments, bug reports to Niles Ritter
  (ndr@tazboy.jpl.nasa.gov). Sam Leffler takes no responsibility
  for the viability of this stuff.
