Since I needed it, and the support for windows-nt versions of libtiff
is sketchy at best, I packaged up my port of libtiff v3.4beta024 
to windows-nt.

	ftp://torii.triple-i.com/pub/ddyer/libtiff.tar.gz

this contains "libtiff.mak", a makefile for microsoft visual c++,
a couple of hand-built .h and .c files (corresponding to those which
are automatically constructed by unix makefiles) and static libraries
compiled for intel and dec alpha.

As customary, I make no claims regarding the completeness or
correctness of these libraries, and accept no responsibily for any
mishaps you may have as a result of using them.  They work for me.

I hope Sam will copy and incorporate this into the "contrib" section
of the next libtiff release.
