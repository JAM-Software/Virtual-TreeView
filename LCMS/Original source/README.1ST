  About profiles
  ==============

    The demo of this package includes some profiles for colorspace
    conversions. I figure all of them are in public domain, but
    since some contains copyright notice, I will enumerate here
    the sources:

         Sun Microsystems Java SDK (widely available)
         Kodak public FTP site: ftp.kodak.com
         ICM Stress demo from microsoft. www.microsoft.com
         sRGB from sRGB site www.srgb.com

    If you found some profile of these not to be in public domain,
    please notify me. I will remove the offending profile as soon as
    posible.



  Additional files
  ================

    ICC34.h is the header file the International Color Consortium
    has posted for version spec 3.4, with some minor modifications
    for improving portability.
