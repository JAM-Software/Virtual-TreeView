UniCodeEditor is an edit control for Delphi, with syntax highlighting and WideString/Unicode support. 
This edit control comes with highlighter classes for Delphi, C/C++, HTML, SQL and others.

Feature list:
- Almost all key commands and editor actions as the Delphi IDE provides are also implemented into USE 
  (block commands, indentation, smart tabulators, real tabulators etc.), the general feel of USE is very similar as in the IDE editor.
- Up to 10 bookmarks.
- Line numbers (with own font for display).
- Visible control chararcters (like tabulators and line separators), see <a href = "images/Syntax6.gif">Image 1</a>.
- Triple click for marking an entire line.
- Virtually unlimited undo/redo.
- Scroll hint window for quick lookup of current top line.
- Drag'n drop support (also between different edits in the same application, OLE drag'n drop will later be implemented).
- Customizable gutter.
- Markable line (like the mark for syntax errors in the Delphi IDE).
- Customizable carets.
- Fast and flicker free display.
- Basic IME support (currently not correctly working).
- Clipboard support.
- Fixed pitch fonts only (recommended: Courier New, MS Gothic).
- Usage of the Unicode20.zip library which provides some core features like Boyer-Moore and regular expression search.

Happy coding
