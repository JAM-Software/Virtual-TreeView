V5.4.1: (26 May 2014)
  * Added packages for C++ Builder XE6
  * If toAutoChangeScale is set in AutoOptions, the Virtual TreeView control now
    increases the DefaultNodeHeight if the font size is too large to fit.
  * If toAutoChangeScale is set in AutoOptions, the columns widths are now adjusted too.
  * Improved implementation for toRestoreSelection option
  * Fixed possible AV in PaintNodeButton()
  * Now ensuring that both GetHorzScrollBarSliderRect() and
    GetVertScrollBarSliderRect() return a valid value for every code path (Thx to
    Dmitri Dmitrienko). This could cause strange out of resources exceptions with VCL
    styles enabled.
  * Fixed issue #434: Application compiled with Delphi 7 stops responding when you call AddChild 
  * A few minor changes
  
V5.4.0: (22 Apr 2014)
  * Added support for XE6.
  * Added new option toRestoreSelection to TVTSelectionOptions: Set to true if upon refill the previously
    elected nodes should be selected again. The nodes will be identified by its caption only.
  * Added new option toAlwaysSelectNode to TVTSelectionOption enum. If this flag is set, the treeview tries to
    lways have a node selected. This behavior is closer to the Windows TreeView and useful in Windows Explorer
    tyle applications. It is also useful for accessible applications which can indicate having the focus by
    isplaying a selection.
  * Added function TBaseVirtualTree.IsEmpty which returns True if the control has no nodes.  
  * Fixed a wrongly drawn selection after the user scrolled horizontally.
  * Fixed issue #423: Change property TVirtualTreeColumn.Tag to NativeInt. 
  * Implemented #415: Added feature for design time column header dragging and resizing. (Thx to fr0st.brutal)
  * Fixed issue #180: Memory leak in grid demo of Advanced project
  * Implemented #422: Added TBaseVirtualTree.GetFirstChildNoInit() 
  * Fixed issue #420: Add coEditable to TVTColumnOption) by applying the supplied path. Thx to Stefan Glienke.
  * Fixed issue #419: Some issues with changing to edit mode with clicking
  * Fixed issue #430: TVTDragManager memory leak with visual inheritance. Thx to Andreas Hausladen for the patch.
  * Fixed issue #431: Visual bug when using TStringEditLink with large node heights
  * TVclStyleScrollBarsHook.WMMouseMove(): Now preventing possible range check error exception.
  * Now handling WM_MOVE and WM_POSCHNAGED correctly in TVclStyleScrollBarsHook (Thx to Dmitri Dmitrienko)
  * Preventing possible stack overflow in TVirtualTreeHintWindow.ActivateHint (Thx to Dmitri Dmitrienko)
  * Added packages for C++ Builder XE5.
  * Some minor changes, improvements and fixes have been incorporated

V5.3.0: (04 Jan 2014)
  * Fix for issue #159 (Cursor missing in edit with non-standard DPI): Ensuring a minimum size of the edit control
  * Fixed issue #403: Declare TVTGetNodeProc as reference to procedure (for D2009+) 
  * Fixed issue #402: TVTEdit.CNCommand discard all notification except EN_UPDATE due to missing inherited
  * Corrected fix for issue #376 (Incorrect selection paint when toGridExtensions is included in the MiscOptions)
  * Fixed issue #401: OnNodeClick event doesn't trigger in some case, coFixed set for a column
  * Modified #316 (concerning r498). The fix for #316 will only be applied in case toMultiSelect is set.
    If toMultiSelect is not set we can start a drag anywhere in the row.
  * ContentToHTML() and ContentToRTF() now return a string of type RawByteString. 
    Because the generated strings are pre-encoded in UTF-8, the previous type AnsiString caused
    problems in Delphi 2009+ e.g. when this string was written using the VCL TStreamWriter class.
    The helper class TBufferedAnsiString therefore uses RywByteString now as type too.
  * Fixed issue #399: EditDelay not working
  * Fixed issue #400: AltGr+A does not behave as expected for foreign keyboard layouts in VTEdit
  * Fixed issue #388: VirtualStringTree with toFixedIndent causes range check error
  * Edit box when editing a node in a tree with toFixedIndent now has the correct indent
  * Fixed issue #392: Now ensuring that MeasureItemHeight() is only called from the main thread.
  * Fixed #383: Clear vsHasChildren for a node without children even if the children count didn't change.
  * Fixed #377: Wrong font (size, etc) in TargetCanvas in MeasureItem for first node
  * Fixed issue #398 (hoAutoResize causes DFM designer to be modified after loading) by calling TControl.Updating()/Updated() in AdjustAutoSize()
  * Preventing possible AV in TBaseVirtualTree.FontChanged()
  * Fixed 32Bit Integer overflows in Win64 build in TBufferedAnsiString.

  control is being entered using the TAB key. This is consistent with the behavior of the Windows Explorer.

  calling DoGetNodeExtraWidth() in TBaseVirtualTree.GetMaxRightExtend()
