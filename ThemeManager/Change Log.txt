// September 2004:

//              circumstances.
//   - Bug fix: Handling of owner drawn TButton controls improved. Their own drawing is now executed instead of that of TM.
//   - Improvement: TSplitter subclassing (background erasing).
//   - Improvement: Collection of child controls when a control is added for subclassing.
// August 2004:
//   - Bug fix: Mantis #143.
//   - Bug fix: Mantis #109.

//              access them) have been freed.

// November 2002
//   - Improvement: Explicitly clear window lists when a Theme Manager instance is destroyed.
// October 2002
//   - Work around: If a window's handle is destroyed without being recreated before the control is physically destroyed
//                  then TThemeManager will never get a usable notification and never remove the subclassing. Hence
//                  TM takes care now to really recreate the handle.
// September 2002
//   - Bug fix: Check for CM_DENYSUBCLASSING was wrong in HandleControlChange.

// August 2002
//   - Windows XP theme services is now part of Delphi 7. All applicable fixes for theme support in the Delphi 7 VCL
//     have been implemented. Hence neither TThemeServices nor TThemeMgr(Db) is needed anymore for D7 and better.
